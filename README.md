## Git Credential Manager Core

Version v2.29.0 upgrades existing users of [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/) (which was just deprecated) to [Git Credential Manager Core](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core) ("GCM Core", which is the designated successor of the former).
